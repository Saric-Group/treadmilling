Dynamic Monte Carlo model for treadmilling filaments

Polymerisation kinetics are implemented over dynamic reaction steps and the system is relaxed according to the Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme in between dynamic updates

To compile the code run "gcc -O 2Dsim.c -o #YOUR_EXECUTABLE_PATH -lm" from your terminal
