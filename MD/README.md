Molecular dynamics model for treadmilling filaments

The model is implemented in LAMMPS using the GCMC (Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo) and REACTION packages to execute the polymerisation kinetics

To run it you need to install a modified version of LAMMPS on your laptop. You can do this easily by executing "source ./build_lammps.sh" from the command line within this directory.
