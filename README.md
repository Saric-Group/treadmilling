# Treadmilling filaments

This repository contains the Molecular Dynamics and Dynamic Monte Carlo implementations of the coarse-grained treadmilling filaments model presented in ["Self-organisation of mortal filaments: the role of FtsZ treadmilling in bacterial division ring formation" (C. Vanhille-Campos et al. - in press)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.08.539808).

[MD](./MD) contains the Molecular Dynamics implementation, with all files necessary to generate and run treadmilling filaments simulations in LAMMPS. Note that a modified version of LAMMPS is required, which you can install from the same directory.

[MC](./MC) contains the Monte Carlo implementation. To run simulations compile and execute the code (C).

Please refer to the paper for details on the model development.
